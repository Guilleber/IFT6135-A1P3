# IFT6135-Assignment1

## Introduction

This project was made as an assignment for the class IFT6135 at University of Montreal. This is an application of convolutional neural networks to image classification (Cat vs Dog). This project have been realised in collaboration with 3 other students of the same class.

Hyper-parameters have been tuned using local random search arround some initial working parameters. These initial parameters are inspired from https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-VGG-neural-network

## Install & prerequisites

To setup the project, please download the source code and create two additional folders "Models/" and "Data/". "Models/" will contain the model's parameters file once the training is completed. "Data/" should contain three sub-folders "train/", "valid/" and "test/" each one containing the corresponding dataset part splitted in two "Cat/" and "Dog/" folders.

The following instructions must be executed using Python 3 (tested on Python 3.6.2) with the following libraries:
- Pytorch 1.0 (other versions may not work)
- Numpy
- ImageIO
- Pillow

We applied a data augmentation technic to improve the results of our network.
